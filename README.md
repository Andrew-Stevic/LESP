# LESP
This repository is designed as a publicly available database for known LinkedIn Exam Scammers

LESP stands for LinkedIn Exam Scammers Project, formed in August of 2022 by LinkedIn Members who noticed an uptick in the number of exam scammers contacting individuals and purporting to offer exam preparation training. While some of these individuals are actually scammers (i.e. they will take your money without offering value), a large majority of these individuals actually offer services where they will take the exam for you, giving you a certificate that you didn't actually earn. This practice is unethical and violates the ethical standards of most, if not all, certifying bodies.

For the purposes of LESP, both types of individuals will be referred to as scammers, even if the individual is not conducting a scam, but if offering a service where the individual will take an exam for you.

The intention of this project is to raise awareness, apply pressure to the LinkedIn Trust and Safety Team to take action against these profiles, and to reduce the impact of these individuals on the professional community.

This project will serve as a repository for links to profiles of known exam scammers. Each link added to the project will be vetted by the LESP team for accuracy. 

The end goal of this project is to submit a mass amount of evidence to the LinkedIn Trust and Safety regarding the presence of these scammers on their platform, enabling them to take action and remove these scammers from the platform permanently.

Please see the CODE OF CONDUCT document for additional rules regarding submitting links.

Please see the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures document  for how these scammers typically operate, how you can confirm that the scammer is actually conducting a scam or offering exam taking services.

License: This is an open-source community project and as such welcomes submissions from the community. However, for the purposes of having one repository to submit to LinkedIn, please do not fork this project to create your own, as this would create unnecessary noise.
