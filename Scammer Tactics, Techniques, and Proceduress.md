Scammer Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

1. Scammers contact targets by Direct Messages (DMs) on LinkedIn after the target accepts their connection request.
2. Scammers have been observed posing as employees of a legitimate company or listing a legitimate company as their former employer, while keeping the headline of their LinkedIn Profile as if they were still working with the legitimate company. This lends an air of legitimacy to their profile while they conduct their business
3. Scammers have been observed working either as freelancers or as employees of a certification prep company that purports to offer web-based or in person certification preparation training
4. The initial contact from a scammer typically comes in the form of a direct message and often starts with a greeting or asking how the target is doing. The follow up message then inquires if if the target is seeking a cartification.
5. Once the target confirms they are seeking a certification, the scammer then offers training that guarantees a "100% pass rate". This term is key, as certification training programs that are legitimate do NOT offer a 100% pass guarantee.
